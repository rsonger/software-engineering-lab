In **Software Engineering Lab** we study practical techniques for developing maintainable computer graphics software applications. As a 5th-year course in the Information Frontier specialization at International College of Technology (ICT), Kanazawa, it provides credit for the Computer Graphics Laboratory course in the [College of Informatics and Human Communication](https://www.kanazawa-it.ac.jp/ekit/education/curriculum/colleges/informatics/index.html) at [Kanazawa Institute of Technology](https://www.kanazawa-it.ac.jp/ekit/index.html) (KIT).
