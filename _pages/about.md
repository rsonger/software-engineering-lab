In the **Software Engineering Lab** course we study practical techniques for developing interactive computer graphics software applications. The course is attended by 5th-year students in the Information Frontier specialization at International College of Technology (ICT), Kanazawa, and provides credit for the Computer Graphics Laboratory course in the [College of Informatics and Human Communication](https://www.kanazawa-it.ac.jp/ekit/education/curriculum/colleges/informatics/index.html) at [Kanazawa Institute of Technology](https://www.kanazawa-it.ac.jp/ekit/index.html) (KIT).
