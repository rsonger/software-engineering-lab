2. Computer Graphics
3. Rendering
4. Software Frameworks
5. Team Development

## Learning Objectives

Software Engineering is a practice-oriented discipline. This course provides students with hands-on experiences for efficiently developing object-oriented software products using software engineering techniques. In addition, students will have an opportunity to develop the necessary teamwork skills including leadership, collaboration, sharing responsibilities through roles, and continuous learning in a team-based computer graphics software project.

## Course Description

Students will have an opportunity to practice the software engineering techniques they learned in previous years and apply them to the domain of computer graphics (CG). The course begins with teaching the basics of computer graphics through hands-on exercises that build a computer graphics framework with Python and OpenGL. The students will then use their computer graphics frameworks to create a software application in a team development project.

## Content

This website provides notes from the instructor in the form of [Posts](./posts/). Each post is dated and made available in chronological order.

The contents follow the textbook "Developing Graphics Frameworks with Python and OpenGL" which is available [for purchase](https://www.routledge.com/Developing-Graphics-Frameworks-with-Python-and-OpenGL/Stemkoski-Pascale/p/book/9780367721800) or [from open access](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-mono/10.1201/9781003181378/developing-graphics-frameworks-python-opengl-lee-stemkoski-michael-pascale).
